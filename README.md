# Tab Smasher - AI written extension to close tabs

![logo](https://github.com/mattfoster/tab-smasher/blob/main/icon.png?raw=true)

This is a browser extension that lets you close browser tabs by domain and the
first path component. It was 90% I written (ChatGPT and Cody).

To load it, visit:
[about:debugging#/runtime/this-firefox](about:debugging#/runtime/this-firefox)
and hit "Load Temporary Add-on...".

## Questions

### Why?

A: I tend to end up with about a million Jira tabs open and I've wanted a quick
way to close them for ages. Enter [Cody](https://sourcegraph.com/cody) and
ChatGPT.

As to why only one path component, I found that just showing the domain wasn't
enough and want to keep this simple.

### Is this secure?

I have no idea, I only really wrote the readme. 

### What does it look like?
